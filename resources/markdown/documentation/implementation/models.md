For you to more easily connect with the correct database a few ways are possible.

#### Traits

Two traits exist to force a model onto either the tenant or system connection.

- `Hyn\Tenancy\Traits\UsesSystemConnection` to make a model use the system connection.
- `Hyn\Tenancy\Traits\UsesTenantConnection` to make a model use the tenant connection.

The below snippet shows an example of how to force the User model to use the tenant
connection.

```php
namespace App;

use Hyn\Tenancy\Traits\UsesTenantConnection;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use Notifiable, UsesTenantConnection;
    
    // ..
}
```

#### Abstract models

Instead of using the traits one can also simply have the models extend the abstract
models provided in the package.

- `Hyn\Tenancy\Abstracts\SystemModel` can be extended to give easy access to 
the system database connection.
- `Hyn\Tenancy\Abstracts\TenantModel` can be extended to have your Eloquent models 
use the connection of the identified tenant per default.

> Please note these models are using their respective traits.

#### System model override

This package allows you to specify different models to be used for the Customer, 
Hostname and Website models. Tenancy will take care of the relationships on the 
package-end. You also need to implement `Hyn\Tenancy\Contracts\{Model}`

Take this example to add billing from `laravel/cashier` to our application:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Hyn\Tenancy\Contracts\Customer as Contract;
use Laravel\Cashier\Billable;

class Customer extends Authenticatable implements Contract
{
  use Billable;
}
```

All you need to do is update the `tenancy.php` configuration file:

```php
<?php
return [
  'models' => [
      // ..
      
      // Must implement \Hyn\Tenancy\Contracts\Customer
      'customer' => \App\Customer::class,
      // Must implement \Hyn\Tenancy\Contracts\Hostname
      'hostname' => \Hyn\Tenancy\Models\Hostname::class,
      // Must implement \Hyn\Tenancy\Contracts\Website
      'website' => \Hyn\Tenancy\Models\Website::class
  ],
  // ...
];
```
