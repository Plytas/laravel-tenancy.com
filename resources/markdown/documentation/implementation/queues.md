One of the strongest features of Laravel are its queues. One drawback of sending
Jobs into the Queue is that these are executed in a completely different process
depending on your queue configuration including redis and beanstalk.

In order to assist you with tenant aware jobs, a `TenantAwareJob` is available to you.
Instead of applying the `SerializesModel` trait as per suggestion in the Laravel
documentation, you should use this Trait instead.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Jobs;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Hyn\Tenancy\Queue\TenantAwareJob;
use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\Dispatchable;

class ProcessPodcast implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, TenantAwareJob;
    
    // ..
}
```
