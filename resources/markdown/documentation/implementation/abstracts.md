Two abstract models are available to speed up development.

##### TenantModel

The `Hyn\Tenancy\Abstracts\TenantModel` can be extended to have your Eloquent
models use the connection of the identified tenant per default.

##### SystemModel

The `Hyn\Tenancy\Abstracts\SystemModel` can be extended to give easy access
to the system database connection.
