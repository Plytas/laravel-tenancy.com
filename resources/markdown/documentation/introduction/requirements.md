##### System requirements

- [Laravel 5.5](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5), because it is a long term support version.
- PHP 7.0 or up.
- Preferably Ubuntu. But most linux-based operating systems should work.
- Apache 2.4+.
- MySQL 5.7+, MariaDB 10+ or PostgreSQL 9+.

> Please note that MySQL limits username and database length to 32, 
enable in the `tenancy.php` configuration file:  `website > uuid-limit-length-to-32`
to fix this.

##### Elevated database user

Tenancy requires a system connection that allows creating new databases for her
tenants. In order to do so we need to have a database user with elevated
permissions.

A user for both [MariaDB or MySQL][1] and [PostgreSQL][2] would require the "GRANT OPTION" to be
applied. You can either use the root user (for PostgreSQL that is user postgres) or create
your own (recommended):

For MariaDB:
```mysql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS tenancy;
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS tenancy@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'someRandomPassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO tenancy@localhost WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

For PostgreSQL:
```postgresql
CREATE DATABASE tenancy;
CREATE USER tenancy WITH CREATEDB CREATEROLE PASSWORD 'someRandomPassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON tenancy to tenancy WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

Make sure you configure this user as your system connection in your `database.php`.
Under connections:

```php
'system' => [
    'driver' => 'mysql', // or pgsql in case you use PostgreSQL
    'username' => 'tenancy',
    'database' => 'tenancy',
    'password' => 'someRandomPassword',
    // Remaining settings required for this specific driver.
]
```

> There is no need to configure the `tenant` connection in the `database.php`
configuration file. This connection is set up automatically during runtime. Pre-
configuring this connection may cause unwanted behaviour.
