- [Laravel 5.5](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5), because it is a long term support version.
- PHP 7.0 or up.
- Preferably ubuntu. But most linux-based operating systems should work.
- Apache 2.4+.
- MariaDB 10+ or PostgreSQL 9+.
Please note that MySQL is not supported per default due to username and database length limits
of 32 characters. A work around is available though.
