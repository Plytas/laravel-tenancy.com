##### Configuration

Tenancy natively integrates with the Apache webserver. For that to work you need
to do a minor configuration.

Edit the `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` and just below the last `IncludeOptional` statement
add:

```apacheconfig
IncludeOptional <path>/*.conf
```

Where `<path>` has to be replaced by the location of your vhost files generated by this package.

> Your vhost files are saved by default inside the `storage/app/tenancy/webserver/apache` and
can be reconfigured in the `webserver.php` configuration file.

Make sure to reload apache afterwards:

```bash
sudo apache2ctl graceful
```
